        <h2>About ACTS</h2>
        <p>
            ACTS is a test generation tool for constructing t-way combinatorial test sets developed using the Java API. ACTS allows the user to define a System Under Test (SUT) with constraints and relations. Currently, ACTS supports t-way test set generation with t ranging from 1 to 6.  Combinatorial testing has been shown very effective in detecting faults that are caused by unexpected interactions between different contributing factors.
