        <h1>ACTS Installation</h1>
        <p >
            ACTS is currently distributed as an executable jar file. That is, 
            the jar file can be double-clicked to start the tool.
            The user is suggested to make a shortcut to the jar file on the desktop so that the tool can
            be quickly started by double-clicking the shortcut, i.e. without stepping through the
            directory structure to find it.
            ACTS requires J2SE 6.0 or above, and has been developed and mainly tested in
            Windows. However, the portability feature of Java shall allow the tool to be executed on
            other platforms such as Linux and Unix.
